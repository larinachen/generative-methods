# A3: Drawing Tool

### The brushes!
1. RAYS: draws black radial lines originating at where the mouse is pressed
2. SPARKLER: the brush stroke simulates what you would see when you wave a sparkler around - a trail of sparks accompanied by glare
3. FLOW: brush stroke simulating a current flowing and tumbling. An experiment with curves and shapes

The clean canvas buttons are from the starter code from Prof.Kate Compton

### One related thought from the reading:
Casual Creators: Designing Tools for Casual Creativity prompted me to consider balancing power with explorability and creative ownership - getting this balanace right is crucial to ensure that software acts as a tool to assist and encourage human creativity instead of replacing humans as the creators. Keeping this thought in my mind, I was curious to observe the balance of power vs. explorability in the brushes I made and consider how that affected my experience playing with them. Personally, I enjoyed playing with the brushes that offered more explorability and elements of surprise.
