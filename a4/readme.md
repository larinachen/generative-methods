# A4: Particle Swarms

### Particle system 1: Mini Mice Flock
Mini Mice Flock is based on the Boids flock starter code. The goal is to simulate a flock of baby mice scurrying around
in flocks. This system can be manipulated using 3 sliders: avoidance, cohesion, and alignment. The debugging visualization shows the velocities of the particles in the flock. Degubbing visualizations of the avoidance, cohesion, and aligment forces are also available in boids-particles.js (commented out to avoid crowding with too many debugging arrows).
 
### Particle system 2: Mice & Cheese
Mice & Cheese is based on the Braitenberg particles system starter code. The "cheese" serves as nodes, and mice travels with both linear & angular velocities when they are "under the influence of cheese" (i.e. close in proximity as indicated by the circles around the cheeses). Debugging visualizations shows the velocity of the mouse and the accelerative force they experience from the cheese. Sliders: miceSpeed, miceTurn, cheeseInducedCraziness (how strongly the cheese accelerates a mouse).

### Particle system 3: Cat Claw
Cat Claw is based on the spring particles system starter code. The particles represent the claws on a cat's paw, with the center particle acting as the palm part of the claw. The edges replicates the interconnected structure between the claws, with the longest edge as the arm connecting the claw to the cat's body (as seen on bottom right of the canvas). Debugging visualization shows the particles and edges between. Sliders: springStrength, springEase, clawExtension (extends/retracts the claws out and away from each other)


### One related thought from the reading:
I think particles is a really great representation of explorability vs. power. It was very interesting to think about how much control I want the users to have on how my particles move --  what features I would love for them to change & play around with vs. what I want my program to do irregardless of what the user does.
